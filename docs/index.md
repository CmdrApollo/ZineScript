# Welcome

Welcome to the wonderful world of ZineScript! If you're new here (or to zines at all), this is just the section for you!

To start, "What is a zine?"

> Zines, for those who don't know, are a type of self-published short-form physical or digital media. The name "zine" is a shortening of the word "magazine".

"What is ZineScript and why did you make it?"

> ZineScript aims to bring zine creation to those with more programming-oriented minds. Originally conceived as a zine-like twist on [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/), ZineScript is a lua-based scripting environment for programmatically creating/generating zines.

"How can I get started with ZineScript?"

## Installation

ZineScript can be installed on my itch page, [here](https://cmdrapollo.itch.io/ZineScript/). Purchasing or donating to ZineScript is strictly **not necessary**, but is greatly appreciated if you have the funds! Once you install the zipped folder, simply extract it to whatever folder you wish.

## Where do I go From Here?

From here, I recommend you check out the [tutorial](tutorial/)! Otherwise, you can just jump straight into the [documentation](documentation/) or check out the [example programs](examples/)!

## Gallery

I wanted to show off a few of the things that ZineScript is capable of here. To start, we have my own personal zine, "House of Ascii". This zine represents the shallow end of the spectrum. It only really uses a few functions, and mainly engages readers with text.

Next is something a little more extreme that shows off more of what ZineScript can handle. This zine is more image-heavy, and I'm sure you can see how this type of zine can be expanded upon into a more fleshed-out collage-style zine or even a more all-over-the-place, psychedelic zine.
